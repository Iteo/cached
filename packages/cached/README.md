<h1>Cached</h1>

Simple Dart package with build-in code generation. It simplifies and speedup creation of cache mechanism for dart
classes.

## Least Recently Used (LRU) cache algorithm

It is a finite key-value map using
the [Least Recently Used (LRU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_algorithms#Least_Recently_Used) algorithm, where the
most recently-used items are "kept alive" while older, less-recently used items are evicted to make room for newer
items.

Useful when you want to limit use of memory to only hold commonly-used things or cache some API calls.

## Motivation

There is quite often situation, that you have to cache something in memory for later usage. Common case is cache some
API calls and theirs responses.
Usually, it is done in some data layer, probably in - let say - `RemoteRepository`

Oftentimes, the repository code might look like this:

```dart
class RemoteRepository implements Repository {
  final SomeApiDataSource _dataSource;
  final SomeResponseType? cachedResponse;

  const RemoteRepository(this._dataSource);

  @override
  Future<SomeResponseType> getSthData() async {
    if (cachedResponse != null) {
      return cachedResponse;
    }

    cachedResponse = await _dataSource.getData();
    return cachedResponse;
  }
}
```

So, instead of doing it manually we can use library and write our `RemoteRepository` in that way:

```dart
@WithCache()
abstract mixin class RemoteRepository implements Repository, _$RemoteRepository {
  factory RemoteRepository({required SomeApiDataSource dataSource,}) = _RemoteRepository;

  @Cached()
  Future<SomeResponseType> getSthData() {
    return dataSource.getData();
  }
}
```

## Setup

### Install package

Run command:

```shell
flutter pub add --dev cached
flutter pub add --dev build_runner
flutter pub add cached_annotation
```

Or manually add the dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
dependencies:
  cached_annotation:

dev_dependencies:
  cached:
  build_runner:
```

That's it! Now, you can write your own cached class :tada:

### Run the generator

To run the code generator, execute the following command:

```shell
dart run build_runner build
```

For Flutter projects, you can run:

```shell
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

Note that like most code-generators, [Cached] will need you to both import the annotation ([cached_annotation])
and use the `part` keyword on the top of your files.

As such, a file that wants to use [Cached] will start with:

```dart
import 'package:cached_annotation/cached_annotation.dart';

part 'some_file.cached.dart';
```

### Dart 3 changes

Dart 3 introduces a change in the way how mixins work, requiring them to be declared with the mixin keyword.
If you are migrating from Dart 2 to Dart 3, you need to add the mixin keyword to your `Cached` class declarations.

Dart 3:
```dart
@WithCache()
abstract mixin class Gen implements _$Gen {
  factory Gen() = _Gen;

  ...
}
```

Dart 2:
```dart
@WithCache()
abstract class Gen implements _$Gen {
  factory Gen() = _Gen;

  ...
}
```

## Basics

### WithCache

Annotation for `Cached` package.

Annotating a class with `@WithCache` will flag it as a needing to be processed by `Cached` code generator.
\
It can take one additional boolean parameter `useStaticCache`. If this parameter is set to true, generator will generate
cached class with static cache. It means each instance of this class will have access to the same cache. Default value
is set to `false`

```dart
@WithCache(useStaticCache: true)
abstract mixin class Gen implements _$Gen {
  factory Gen() = _Gen;

  ...
}
```

### Cached

Method/Getter decorator that flag it as needing to be processed by `Cached` code generator.

There are 4 possible additional parameters:

- `ttl` - time to live. In seconds. Set how long cache will be alive. Default value is set to null, means infinitive
  ttl.
- `syncWrite` - Affects only async methods ( those one that returns Future ) If set to `true` first method call will be
  cached, and if following ( the same ) call will occur, all of them will get result from the first call. Default value
  is set to `false`;
- `limit` - limit how many results for different method call arguments combination will be cached. Default value null,
  means no limit.
- `where` - function triggered before caching the value. If returns `true`: value will be cached, if returns `false`: value wil be ignored. Useful to signal that a certain result must not be cached, but `@IgnoreCache` is not enough (e.g. condition whether or not to cache known once acquiring data)

> **Important:** 
> 
> Please note, that `persistentStorage` is marked as `@Deprecated` and will be removed with next release. We encourage the use of `@PersistentCached` annotation

- `persistentStorage` - Defines optional usage of external persistent storage (e.g. shared preferences). If set to `true` in order to work, you have to set `PersistentStorageHolder.storage` in your main.dart file. Check the [Persistent storage section](#persistent-storage) of this README for more information.

#### Example

```dart
@Cached(
  ttl: 60,
  syncWrite: true,
  limit: 100,
)
Future<int> getInt(String param) {
  return Future.value(1);
}
```

#### Example with getter

```dart
@cached
Future<int> get getter {
  return Future.value(1);
}
```

#### where

As mentioned before, `where` takes top-level function to check whether to cache value or not. It also supports `async` calls, so feel free to create conditional caching based on e.g. `http` response parsing.

##### sync example

```dart
@Cached(
  ttl: 60,
  syncWrite: true,
  limit: 100,
  where: _shouldCache
)
int getInt(String param) {
  return 1;
}

bool _shouldCache(int candidate) {
  return candidate > 0;
}
```

##### async example

```dart
@Cached(
  where: _asyncShouldCache,
)
Future<http.Response> getDataWithCached() {
  return http.get(Uri.parse(_url));
}

Future<bool> _asyncShouldCache(http.Response response) async {
  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map<String, dynamic>;
  print('Up to you: check conditionally and decide if should cache: $json');

  print('For now: always cache');
  return true;
}

```

### IgnoreCache

That annotation must be above a field in a method and must be bool,
if `true` the cache will be ignored

Example use:

```dart
@cached
Future<int> getInt(String param, {@ignoreCache bool ignoreCache = false}) {
  return Future.value(1);
}
```

or you can use with `useCacheOnError` in the annotation and if set `true`
then return the last cached value when an error occurs.

```dart
@cached
Future<int> getInt(String param, {@IgnoreCache(useCacheOnError: true) bool ignoreCache = false}) {
  return Future.value(1);
}
```

Possible reason why the generator gives an error

- if method has multiple `@ignoreCache` annotation

### Ignore

That annotation must be above a field in a method,
arguments with `@ignore` annotations will be ignored while generating cache key.

Example use:

```dart
@cached
Future<int> getInt(@ignore String param) {
  return Future.value(1);
}
```

### CacheKey

That annotation must be above a field in a method and must contain constant function that will
return cache key for provided field value

Example use:

```dart
@cached
Future<int> getInt(@CacheKey(exampleCacheFunction) int test) async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 20));
  return test;
}

String exampleCacheFunction(dynamic value) {
  return value.toString();
}
```

You can also use `@iterableCacheKey`, which will generate cache key from `Iterable<T>` values

Example use:

```dart
@cached
Future<List<int>> getInt(@iterableCacheKey List<int> test) async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(milliseconds: 20));
  return test;
}
```

### ClearCached

Method decorator that flag it as needing to be processed by `Cached` code generator.
Method annotated with this annotation can be used to clear result of method annotated with `Cached` annotation.
\
Constructor of this annotation can take one possible argument. It is method name, that we want to clear the cache.

Let say there is existing cached method:

```dart
@Cached()
Future<SomeResponseType> getUserData() {
  return userDataSource.getData();
}
```

to generate clearing cache method we can write:

```dart
@clearCached
void clearGetUserData();
```

or

```dart
@ClearCached('getUserData')
void clearUserData();
```

The `ClearCached` argument or method name has to correspond to cached method name. We can also create a method that
returns a bool, and then write our own logic to check if the cache should be cleared or not.

```dart
@ClearCached('getUserData')
Future<bool> clearUserData() {
  return userDataSource.isLoggedOut();
}
```

If the user is logged out, the user cache will be cleared.

Possible reasons why the generator gives an error

- if method with `@cached` annotation doesn’t exist
- if method to pair doesn’t exist
- if method don’t return `bool`, `Future<bool>` or not a `void`, `Future<void>`

### ClearAllCached

This is exactly the same as `ClearCached`, except you don't pass any arguments and you don't add a clear statement
before the method name, all you have to do is add `@clearAllCached` above the method, this annotation will clear cached
values for all methods in the class with the `@WithCache`.

Here is a simple example:

```dart
@clearAllCached
void clearAllData();
```

or we can also create a method that returns a bool, and then write our own logic to check if cached values for all
methods will be cleared

```dart
@clearAllCached
Future<bool> clearAllData() {
  return userDataSource.isLoggedOut();
}
```

If the user is logged out, will clear cached values for all methods

Possible reasons why the generator gives an error

- if we have too many `clearAllCached` annotation, only one can be
- if method don’t return `bool`, `Future<bool>` or not a `void`

### StreamedCache

Use `@StreamedCache` annotation to get a stream of cache updates from a cached method.
Remember to provide at least the name of the cached class method in the `methodName` parameter.

Simple example of usage:

```dart
@cached
int cachedMethod() {
  return 1;
}

@StreamedCache(methodName: "cachedMethod", emitLastValue: true)
Stream<int> cachedStream();
```

Method annotated with `@StreamedCache` should have same parameters (except `@ignore` or `@ignoreCache`)
as method provided in `methodName` parameter, otherwise `InvalidGenerationSourceError` will be thrown.
Return type of this method should be a `Stream<sync type of target method>` - for example for `Future<String>`
the return type will be `Stream<String>`

Example:

```dart
@cached
Future<String> cachedMethod(int x, @ignore String y) async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(miliseconds: 100));
  return x.toString();
}

@StreamedCache(methodName: "cachedMethod", emitLastValue: false)
Stream<String> cachedStream(int x);
```

### CachePeek

Method decorator that flag it as needing to be processed by `Cached` code generator.
Method annotated with this annotation can be used to peek result of method annotated with `Cached` annotation.

Constructor of this annotation can take one possible argument. It is method name, that we want to peek the cache.

Let say there is existing cached method:

```dart
@Cached()
Future<SomeResponseType> getUserData() {
  return userDataSource.getData();
}
```

to generate peek cache method we can write:

```dart
@CachePeek("getUserData")
SomeResponseType? peekUserDataCache();
```

The `CachePeek` methodName argument has to correspond to cached method name

Possible reasons why the generator gives an error

- if more then one method is targeting [Cached] method cache
- if method return type is incorrect
- if method has different parameters then target function (excluding [Ignore], [IgnoreCache])
- if method is not abstract

### DeletesCache

@DeletesCache annotaton is a method decorator that marks method to be processed by code generator. Methods preceeded by this annotation clear the cache of all specified methods, annotated with @Cached, if they complete with result.

@DeletesCache annotation takes a list of cached methods that are affected by the use of annotated method, the cache of all specified methods is cleared on method success, but if an error occurs, the cache is not deleted and the error is rethrown.

If there is a cached method:

```dart
@Cached()
Future<SomeResponseType> getSthData() {
  return dataSource.getData();
}
```

Then a method that affects the cache of this method can be written as:

```dart
@DeletesCache(['getSthData'])
Future<SomeResponseType> performOperation() {
  ...
  return data;
}
```

All methods specified in @DeletesCache annotation must correspond to cached method names. If the performOperation method completes without an error, then the cache of getSthData will be cleared.

Throws an [InvalidGenerationSourceError]

- if method with @cached annotation doesn't exist
- if no target method names are specified
- if specified target methods are invalid
- if annotated method is abstract

### UpdateCache

Method decorator that flags a method as needing to be processed by the `Cached` code generator for updating cache entries.

The `@UpdateCache` annotation allows you to create methods that update the cache of existing cached methods. When you call an update method, it will both execute the method logic and update the corresponding cache entry with the new result.

The constructor takes one required parameter:
- `methodName` - The name of the cached method whose cache should be updated

#### Basic Usage

For a cached method:

```dart
@Cached()
Future<User> getUser(String id) {
  return userDataSource.getUser(id);
}
```

You can create an update method:

```dart
@UpdateCache('getUser')
Future<User> updateUser(String id, User updatedUser) {
  // Update the user in your data source
  final result = await userDataSource.updateUser(id, updatedUser);
  // The cache will be automatically updated with the result
  return result;
}
```

#### Error Handling

If the update method throws an exception, the cache will not be updated, maintaining the previous cached value:

```dart
@UpdateCache('getUser')
Future<User> updateUser(String userId, User updatedUser) async {
  try {
    final result = await dataSource.updateUser(userId, updatedUser);
    return result; // Cache updated only on success
  } catch (e) {
    // Cache remains unchanged
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

## Persistent storage
Cached library supports usage of any external storage (e.g. Shared Preferences, Hive), by using `@PersistentCached()` annotation:

> Actual version

```dart
  @PersistentCached()
  Future<double> getDouble() async {
    return await _source.nextDouble() ;
  }
```

> @Deprecated version

```dart
  @Cached(persistentStorage: true)
  Future<double> getDouble() async {
    return await _source.nextDouble() ;
  }
```

You only have to provide a proper interface by extending `CachedStorage` abstraction, e.g.:

```dart
...
import 'package:cached_annotation/cached_annotation.dart';

class MyStorageImpl extends CachedStorage {
  final _storage = MyExternalStorage();

  @override
  Future<Map<String, dynamic>> read(String key) async {
    return await _storage.read(key);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> write(String key, Map<String, dynamic> data) async {
    await _storage.write(key, data);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> delete(String key) async {
    await _storage.delete(key);
  }

  @override
  Future<void> deleteAll() async {
    await _storage.deleteAll();
  }
}
```

Now you have to assign instance of your class (preferably on the top of your `main` method):

```dart
...
import 'package:cached_annotation/cached_annotation.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();

  PersistentStorageHolder.storage = await MyStorageImpl();
  
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

As you can see above, Cached doesn't provide any generic way of error or typing handling. It'll just use `PersistentStorageHolder.storage` to save and read cached data from storage in generated code. You have to take care of it yourself inside your code.  

## Lazy persistent storage
Additional feature available only for `@LazyPersistentCached()` is initialize cache from external storage only after method call.
This solution makes it possible to bypass a heavy initial load for large amounts of data.

```dart
  @LazyPersistentCached()
  Future<double> getDouble() async {
    return await _source.nextDouble() ;
  }
```

## Direct persistent storage

When the `@DirectPersistedCached` annotation is used, it prevents the automatic loading of data from external storage into the cache managed by the caching library. For methods with this annotation, the library's generator neither creates a map for storing data fetched from the storage nor initializes such a map before the method's invocation. Consequently, setting this parameter ensures that data is always fetched directly from externalStorage upon method call. If the data is not already present in externalStorage, it is retrieved and then stored there.

```dart
  @DirectPersistedCached()
  Future<double> getDirectDouble() async {
    return await _source.nextDouble() ;
  }
```

Data saved to persistent storage can be deleted by using `@ClearCached()`, `@ClearAllCached()` or `@DeletesCache` annotations.

Usage of persistent storage does not change this library caching behaviour in any way. It only adds new capabilities, but it can affect the way in which you implement your app:

> **Important:** 
> 
> Please note, that persistent storage usage enforces you to provide async API when using Cached annotations! 

For sample project, please check `persistent_storage_example` inside `cached/example` directory.
